                <p>The Squirrel Nation has revered the Great Pine Tree for many generations.
    Every few years the Great Pine Tree produces a single Mega Cone that is
    treasured and revered in an almost religious manner. If something were
    to happen to this most sacred cone, all of squirrelkind
    would descend into turmoil...</p>

    <p>Now the unspeakable has happened: The Mega Cone has disappeared!</p>

    <p>The Cone Copter Guard are the devout guardians of the Great Pine Tree and the Squirrel
    Nation. Take your place among the daring pilots and spare no cone to fulfill your duty!
    Your task as the pilot of the Cone Helicopter Guard is to find it and in so doing pass
    the game. Try to also collect as many regular cones as possible along the way. They
    serve as fuel for your chopper and give you points.</p>

    <p>Be careful, because if you run out
    of cones, it's game over. Extra cones will be used to plant trees for the good
    of all squirrelkind! One for all and all for the cones!</p>
